# AI log

How the AI agent (Claude Code) was used, what it produced, and where it was wrong. Updated as the work happens, in the same PR as the change. The README section "How I worked with AI" is built from this file.

## Phase 1: CI, data, validator

**Prompt (summary):** "Let's move on with Phase 1 of the etf kompas project. I have just added the starter guide." The agent read the guide, `docs/PHASES.md` and SPEC §5, §12a, §15, §17, §18, §21, §22 and §29, then proposed a plan and open questions before writing anything (per `CLAUDE.md`). Follow-up prompts: write and sync `CLAUDE.md`, start each PR, fix CI, tidy git.

**Produced**

- `CLAUDE.md` (SPEC §29), later synced with conventions from the author's other projects.
- PR 1: Vitest (unit and components projects), Playwright (mobile first), `src/server` lint rule, GitHub Actions CI with actions pinned to commit SHAs resolved via the GitHub API.
- PR 2: Zod data schema, framework-free `validateData`, 26 tests written first and approved before implementation, seed data for 8 ETFs and 5 brokers (all `TODO_VERIFY`), `data:validate` and `data:validate:draft`.
- Small fix PR: deprecated Sass `map-get` replaced with `map.get`.
- Decision notes 0001 to 0005 and this log (merged), then notes 0006 to 0014 for the remaining SPEC §22 seed topics (drafted from SPEC rationale, status `accepted` after David read them).

**Mistakes and corrections**

- **Commit author email blocked the first push.** The scaffold commits used the author's full personal email, and GitHub rejected the push of `main` (email privacy setting). The agent had not checked the author email before pushing. Fix: history rewritten once to the noreply address, then force-pushed.
- **Another project's name in a commit message.** The agent named the author's earlier project in a commit message ("sync CLAUDE.md with ... conventions") and repeated it in the PR body. David did not want it. Fix: the commit was reworded (second rewrite of `main`, ruleset disabled for the push) and the PR body edited. The old text may remain reachable through GitHub's PR refs.
- **CI failed on `esbuild`.** Adding `tsx` pulled in `esbuild`, which has an install script, and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` fails in CI until each build script is allowed or denied. Locally the install did not fail, so the agent did not catch it before pushing. The starter guide lists `esbuild: false` in `allowBuilds`, but the repo's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` was missing it. Fix: line added.
- **First draft of the validator tests was incomplete.** The ETF fixture had only three fields, so the "valid dataset" test would have failed with `MALFORMED` once the schema required all fields. Caught while implementing; fixtures were completed and approved tests kept their meaning.
- **Commit on the wrong branch.** The first commit of this PR landed on local `main` because a chained shell command failed halfway and the branch switch did not take effect. The agent noticed from `git status` (`main` ahead by 1) before anything reached `origin/main` (the ruleset would also have blocked it), moved the commit to the feature branch and reset local `main`.
- **Spec gap handled by the agent, not the spec.** SPEC §5 requires the build to fail on `TODO_VERIFY` while §18 requires placeholders, so strict CI would be red from day one. The agent proposed a draft mode (note 0003); David approved after asking why it was needed.
- **Brokers were not named in the spec.** The agent suggested five from general knowledge. They are unverified suggestions; all facts about them are `TODO_VERIFY` (note 0004).

**Starter-guide details verified instead of copied**

- `pnpm/setup` exists (v3.1.0) and its `runtime` and `cache` inputs are valid; `require-lockfile` was added.
- `resolve.tsconfigPaths` is supported by the installed Vite 8.
- Dropped from the guide: `next-intl` inline dependency in the Vitest config (next-intl is not used), React Hook Form.
- `@types/node` raised from `^20` to `^24` because Vitest 5 requires it (peer dependency) and the project runs Node 24.

## Phase 1b: design foundation

**Prompt (summary):** "Plan Phase 1b", then: use the wireframe canvas as the design, build a documented palette and design guide from it, and prepare wireframe B as text from the link.

**Produced**

- `docs/design/DESIGN-GUIDE.md`, `docs/design/wireframe-b.md` and `docs/design/README.md`, written from the design canvas (all 12 boards). Palette, type, spacing, components and motion are the values the canvas uses. Contrast ratios were calculated, not estimated.

**Mistakes and corrections**

- The agent's first plan proposed choosing fonts and a palette itself. The canvas already defined both (IBM Plex Sans and Mono, a warm neutral palette with two accents), so the plan was changed to extract them.
- Flagged while reading the canvas, not yet decided: the wireframe has no initial-amount input although SPEC §4 and §21 do, and its hero table animation (about 3 s) conflicts with the SPEC rule that only the result count-up animates (see `docs/design/wireframe-b.md`, open points).
- David's answers (initial amount dropped, hero animation kept, wireframe copy wins, `?v=a` is the calculator hero) are recorded in notes 0015 to 0017 and in SPEC §4, §21 and §24. The SPEC edits were made only because David decided them, per the rule "ask before changing the spec's decisions".

### Phase 1b PR 1: tokens, fonts, contrast check

- Produced: complete token set in `src/app/variables.scss`, Plex fonts via `next/font`, `pnpm contrast:check` with unit tests, a first `/styleguide` page and e2e tests for fonts, diacritics and tabular figures, decision note 0018.
- Checked instead of assumed: the glyph-coverage e2e test was run against a character the font lacks (it flags it) and a Czech one (it passes). The tabular-figures test turned out not to be discriminating, because Plex Sans digits are tabular by default; the note and the test comment say so.
- Wireframe font sizes were merged into a smaller scale. This changes some sizes by 1 to 2 px and needs David's review on `/styleguide`.
- **Mistake: the first glyph-coverage test was unsound.** It compared a character's width in the Plex stack with its width in plain `serif`. On the GitHub Linux runner `ý` has the same width in both, so CI failed (false alarm), and a truly missing glyph would have fallen back to a different font than `serif` and could have gone unnoticed. The agent had "verified" it only with an Armenian letter, which both fallbacks render with the same system font. Fix: measure with a serif and a monospace fallback and compare the two; a glyph the web font has gives the same width in both. Checked with `ǆ` (missing in Plex, flagged). It still cannot detect scripts where both fallbacks resolve to the same system font, which is fine for Czech.
